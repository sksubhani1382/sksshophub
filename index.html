        <p>  What will you do if you suddenly realize that there is no milk or bread in the fridge? Or, what if you just feel like 
             having a burger but are too lazy to go out? The best option available with you is ordering the items ‘online’. And for
             this, all you need is to pick up your smartphone, log in to the respective grocery or food online delivery app to order,
             and then receive your order in just the next couple of minutes. Isn’t this process so simple and relaxing!! And, not just 
             food or grocery, one can make quick online purchases for apparels, gadgets, electronics, furniture, books, footwear, 
             accessories, jewelry, etc.
